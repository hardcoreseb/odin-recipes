    <h1>Chicken Congee</h1>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        The word "congee" was derived from from the Tamil language of Ancient India, "kanji". In Cantonese, <br>
        we call it "jÅ«k" (which kinda sounds like "jook"), but there are many, many different variations and <br>
        names for it across Asia. <br>
        <br>
        Even though congee is commonly known as a rice porridge, it wasn't always the case. With thousands of <br>
        years of history in China, congee was made with whatever grains were available locally: <br>
        millet, cornmeal, barley, and etc.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>   
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup sushi rice</li>
            <li>finely julienned ginger, to serve</li>
            <li>thinly sliced spring onion (scallions), to serve</li>
            <li>soy sauce, to drizzle</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Chicken stock:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1.2kg whole chicken</li>
            <li>8 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>4cm piece fresh ginger, sliced</li>
            <li>4 spring onions, rougly sliced</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place all the ingredients for the chicken stock in a large saucepan over <br>
                medium-high heat. Bring to a gentle simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer <br>
                for 40 minutes or until the chicken is just cooked. You can test by <br>
                piercing the leg joint and if the juices run clear or just light pink, then the <br>
                chicken is cooked. Simmer for longer if your chicken is larger. When cooked, <br>
                transfer the chicken to a plate and allow to cool.
            </li>
            <li>
                Strain the chicken stock into another clean saucepan over medium-high <br>
                heat. Add the rice and simmer until the rice is broken down and the mixture <br>
                is thick and porridge-like (this could take 60-90 minutes). Stir often to <br>
                ensure the rice doesn't burn. 
            </li>
            <li>Slice and shred the chicken meat. </li>
            <li>
                To serve, divide the congee among serving bowls. Top with the chicken meat, <br>
                ginger, spring onion and drizzle with soy sauce to taste. 
            </li>
        </ol>
