    <p><u>Description:</u></p>
    <p>
        Guacamole is an avocado-based dip, spread, or salad first developed in Mexico.
        In addition to its use in modern Mexican cuisine, it has become part of 
        international and American cuisine as a dip, condiment and salad ingredient.

        Ingredients:
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh serrano chili</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup finley diced white onion</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt for grinding vegetables, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>4 large Hass avocados</li>

        Steps:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place minced peppers, 1/4 cup of the chopped cilantro, and the diced onions<br>
                on a cutting board. Chop them together into very small pieces. Sprinkle with <br>
                kosher salt. Using the flat side of the knife blade, smear the mixture to work it <br>
                into a paste, and chop again to achieve as fine texture as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stem, halve, and pit the avocados. Scoop out flesh and place in a bowl.

            <li>
                Add 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, onion and serrano mixture, salt, and fresh lime <br>
                juice. Mash with a potato masher to desired texture (smooth or chunky), five or <br>
                six minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Taste and adjust seasonings. If not serving immediately, cover and refrigerate.
