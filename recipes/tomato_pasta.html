    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>A weeknight pasta with the mood of a weekend bagel.</p>
    <p>
        Just like the names suggest, cream cheese plus sun-dried tomatoes equals a <br>
        supremely creamy, cheesy tomato sauce—two ingredients, zero fuss. All it needs is a <br>
        big splash of salty, starchy pasta water to yield an Alfredo-like consistency, ideal for <br>
        hugging long noodles. I'm a fan of spaghetti and bucatini here, but fettuccine, <br>
        linguini, or even ramen would all be great. (And, yes, a short shape, like rigatoni, <br>
        would work in a pinch.)
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (2 ounces) capers, patted dry</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>8 ounces spaghetti or bucatini</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper or red pepper flakes, to taste (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Set a large pot of water over high heat to come to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, in a large bowl, use a fork to mash the <br>
                minced tomatoes into the cream cheese, until the <br>
                cream cheese is rosy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set a small skillet over medium heat and add 2 <br>
                tablespoons of tomato oil. Add the capers and cook, <br>
                stirring once or twice, for 2 to 4 minutes, until they're <br>
                puffed and starting to brown. Turn off the heat, then <br>
                use a fork to transfer them to a towel-lined plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the water is boiling, generously season it with <br>
                salt. Add the pasta and cook according to the <br>
                package directions until al dente. Just before the <br>
                pasta is done, scoop out about 1 cup of pasta water.
            </li>
            <li>
                While stirring with a fork, pour ¼ cup of pasta water <br>
                into the tomato cream cheese. Use tongs to add the <br>
                pasta and toss to coat, adding more pasta water to <br>
                sight (about ⅓ cup for me) until the consistency is <br>
                where you want it, keeping in mind that it will thicken <br>
                as it cools. Season to taste with salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the pasta between two shallow bowls or plates <br>
                and evenly top with the fried capers, plus black <br>
                pepper or red pepper flakes if you'd like.
            </li>
        </ol>
