    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>
        You know me and fusion pasta - it's an absolute passion of mine! This winning dish is so <br>
        simple and incredibly delicious, too, making maximum use from minimal ingredients. It's <br>
        also ideal as a meat-free meal.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>200g (7 oz) linguine or spaghetti</li>
            <li>75g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili flakes</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>3 tbsp finely grated parmesan cheese, plus extra to serve</li>
            <li>2 tbsp finely sliced spring onions (scallions)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the garlic oil, place the oil and the garlic in a small saucepan over <br>
                medium heat. Once the garlic is sizzling, cook for 2-3 minutes or until the <br>
                garlic is just starting to turn golden at the edges. Transfer to a heat-proof <br>
                owl and set aside for later (the garlic will continue cooking and turn evenly <br>
                golden in the bowl).
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a large pot of salted water over high heat. When boiling rapidly, add the <br>
                pasta and cook until al dente.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the pasta is cooking, add the butter, garlic and chilli flakes into a large <br>
                frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook stirring until the butter is just <br>
                melted (you want the garlic to soften but not color), then add the soy <br>
                sauce and oyster sauce. Simmer for a minute and then take off the heat <br>
                until the pasta is cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the pasta is al dente, reserve a cup of pasta cooking liquid in case you <br>
                need it later. Place the butter sauce back on the heat and add the pasta <br>
                straight into the pan. Cook, stirring, for 3-4 minutes or until the liquid has <br>
                been absorbed by the pasta and everything is looking super glossy and thick. <br>
                Toss through the parmesan cheese (add a little pasta cooking water here if <br>
                necessary). Divide among serving plates. Top with a drizzle of garlic oil and <br>
                some garlic chips. Sprinkle with spring onion and add extra cheese.
